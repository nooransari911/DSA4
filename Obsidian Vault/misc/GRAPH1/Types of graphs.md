--> Based on existence of directionality or orientation of edges:
1. Directed, digraph: edges do not have any direction
2. Undirected, undigraph: edges have a direction, towards one of the nodes

--> Based on length/amplitude/weight ofedges:
1. Weighted graph: edges have weights
2. Unweighted graph: edges do not have weights

--> Some common special types
1. Trees: Trees are graphs with ```n``` nodes have ```n-1``` edges.
	1. Rooted tree: Directed trees with a node designated as root. All edges directly connected to root point towards or away from the root.
2. Directed Acyclic Graphs: Directed graphs with no cycles.
3. Bipartite graph: Every edge connects nodes from two mutually exclusive groups of nodes. There are no odd length cycles in graph.
4. Complete Graphs: All nodes are connected to all nodes. Worst case graphs.
