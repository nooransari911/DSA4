1. Focus
2. Directness:: Approach the most crucial aspects of the skill head-on. Involve yourself in project relevant to the field from the very beginning.
3. Drills--active recall--retention:: Repetition. Can you activate this knowledge without having it in front of you?

The prefix meta comes from the Greek word and meta which means beyond. We use meta to signify something related to itself, something self-referential. In our case, meta learning means learning about learning, or learning how to learn.




Focus
Focus. There's nothing more powerful than focusing.

This isn't an easy thing and it is a form of superpower in a distraction-oriented digital world.




Directness
Directness refers to the ability of the learner to approach the most crucial aspects of the skill head-on. Instead of immersing ourselves in the skill itself, we try to find shortcuts or hacks that can make this skill easier to acquire. 


```
We want to speak a language but try to learn mostly by playing fun apps, rather than conversing with actual people.
 
We want to work on collaborative, professional programs, but mostly code scripts in isolation.
 
We want to become great speakers. So we buy a book on communication, rather than practice presenting.
```


In all these cases, the problem is the same: directly learning the thing we want feels too uncomfortable, boring or frustrating. So, we settle for some book lecture or app, hoping it will eventually make us better at the real thing.

The best way to learn is to directly immerse in projects relevant to the field from the beginning.







Experimentation
To really master something, to really reach the levels of creativity and genius that we associate with the kind of end products of a learning goal, you really need to experiment because eventually, you get onto a path that no one's been there before, right? When you are mastering a skill at that high level, you are doing something that no one's done before. So, learning in that sense is not something you can just ask some expert, what's the right way to learn this? Because you are often approaching limits of things that, you know, no one has done it, exactly that way before it. So you have to sort of develop that approach yourself.






In closing

True Mastery comes not just from following the path trodden by others, but also from exploring possibilities they haven't yet imagined.
