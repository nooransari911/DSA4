## Microcontrollers
Microcontrollers are chips with various integrated functions like :
- Microprocessor
- RAM
- Flash/ROM
- Timers
- ADC, DAC
- USB, UART, SPI, I2C


## Naming of PIC microcontrollers
- 32 bit : PIC32
- 16 bit : PIC24
- 8 BIT : PIC 16/18

In 8 bit family, PIC16F1 and PIC18 are newest. Other families (PIC12, non-F1 PIC16) are obsolete.

Prefer `PIC18F46K22-E/P` (INR 400), `PIC18F8723-E/PT` (INR 1400).
