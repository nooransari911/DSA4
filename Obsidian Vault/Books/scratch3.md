Favorite quote from the offer: "Disruptive technology should be framed, as a marketing challenge, not a technological one."  
  
The innovator's dilemma has been on my list forever. The reason I kept putting off was that, I remember seeing the blinks for this book on blink list very early on, but somehow the English version had disappeared today. I finally decided to make do with German version and give it a go shortly. After Steve Jobs died, his biography was released, I read it the year. It came out in 2011 and remembered.  
  
One thing very clearly from it, Steve Jobs said the innovator's dilemma, had deeply influenced him. There were many books have Steve referenced throughout the interviews with his biographer. Let alone business books naturally. I was curious about the one entrepreneurship book, the guy who built the most valuable company in the world red. Likely it was precisely because he recognized and solved. The Dilemma described in the book here.  
  
Our free lessons of what the books about one. There are always two kinds of Technology disruptive. Of and sustaining to, if a company's resources processes and values. Don't match the market. No management can save it.

I'm not sure if Peter feel reference this book. In his business, Manifesto 0 to 1 but it wouldn't surprise me to learn. This is where he got the original idea from Clayton, Christensen published the innovator's dilemma in 1997 and with it disputed the way leaders talked about technological progress. He distinguishes between the two kinds of Technologies, one sustaining Technologies these focus on growing existing Technologies by enhancing their performance mostly for extended functionality or increase capacity.  
  
And to disrupting Technologies, these change the landscape of the entire industry or spark a new one all together because they solve the problem in an entirely new way for an entirely new group of people. As you can imagine established businesses and Market leaders shine. When it comes to the first kind, they have built up enormous efficiency and vast amounts of resources, which makes it easy to provide incremental progress at scale where incumbents often lack imagination and swiftness in destruction.  
  
Example, while it was a piece of cake for IBM to make hard disks thinner and add storage capacity in the 80s. Adopting the new 1.5 inch format didn't come so naturally as long as 14 inch discs, were still selling the best lesson to when the resources processes and values of the company don't match the target market. Even the best management won't help. The reason startups have a chance to overtake industry Titans. When it comes to distribution is that it starts low margin niche.  
  
Markets because the Target customer is often entirely different one than before, big companies are slow and servicing these because two of the three defining factors of a business's culture and capability to act our rigid for them, one resources, anything you can buy sell hire or fire two processes patterns of action and communication, both formal and informal three values. The criteria by which managers and employees make all organizational.  
  
Market, Champions are loaded with resources, but have very hard and process and fixed set of values, which rarely match the new target market. Our disruptive innovation, these three factors are increasingly hard to change, especially short term. So it's no wonder a company like, Kodak has a tough time. Giving new technology, like digital cameras, the real attention, it deserves when your processes and values, don't match the market distribution that forces you to break into even the greatest management won't be able to salvage.

Okay now let's dive into lesson number three, lesson three the way market leaders of innovators dilemma. It's real quipping independent subsidiaries with what they need. So what do you do then?

E from one source as a result, big businesses. Usually try to force you to a New Market to grow fast or wait too long and end up losing the position. Here's a solution Christensen proposed fund or require a subsidiary company with the right values and processes equip it with necessary resources and let it do. Its thing. If you're off two of the three factors, well, use the fur to make up for the first two, when you have a lot of cash and people deploy, some of those in a bold move to Build something that matches what the market needs even before it knows it.
