Men are from Mars, women are from Venus. Venusians look for growth/improvement. Martians look for solutions.

We expect the opposite sex to behave just like us.





Part One: Mr. Fixit and Home Improvement Committee.


The most frequently expressed complaint women have about men is men don't listen. The most frequently expressed complaint men have about women is that women are always trying to change them.




Martians are interested in objects and things rather than people's feelings.

A man's sense of self-worth is in autonomy. For a man, autonomy is a symbol of efficiency, power and competence.

- Because man values autonomy, a man rarely talks about his problems unless he needs expert advice. Asking for help when you can do it yourself is perceived as a sign of weakness. If he truly does need help, then it is a sign of wisdom to get it.




Venusians have different values. They value of communication, beauty, relationships and everything that can nurture life, healing and growth.

A woman's sense of self-worth is defined through her feelings and the quality of her relationships.





- When a woman innocently shares upset feelings, man mistakenly assumes she's looking for some expert advice. He puts on his Mr. Fixit hat and begins giving advice. This is his way of showing love. He has no idea that he can be supportive just by listening with empathy and interest.



- However, a man feels offended when a woman offers unsolicited advice because he doesn't feel she trusts his ability to do it himself. It makes him feel incompetent, week and even unloved.




- A man tries to change a woman's feelings when she is upset by becoming Mr. Fixit on offering solutions to the problems that invalidate her feelings.
- A woman tries to change a man's behavior when he makes mistakes by becoming the Home Improvement committee and offering unsolicited advice or criticism.











Part Two: Men go to their caves and Women talk.

Men feel better by solving problems; women feel better by talking about problems. Men go to their caves to feel better; women get together and openly talk about their problems. 










Part Three: How to Motivate the Opposite Sex

Men need to feel needed; women need to feel loved and cherished.

Women need to feel loved and cherished.

When a woman realize that she truly deserves to be loved, then she opens the door for a man to give to her. Then he also wakes up and wants to give her more.


A man's deepest fear is:
- he is not good enough to give
- he is incompetent

A woman's deepest fear is:
- she is not good enough to receive
- she is unable to develop quality relationships


The first step for a man in learning how to give more is to realize that it's okay to make mistakes and it's okay to fall and that he doesn't have to have all the answers. He needed the acceptance and the encouragement that he was good enough for her and then he could feel how much he cared.

The first step for a woman in learning how to receive more is to realize that she deserves to receive more.






Part Four: Speaking Different Languages.


The biggest challenge for men is correctly to interpret and support a woman when she is talking about her feelings. The biggest challenge for women is correctly to interpret and support a man when he isn't talking. Silence is easily misinterpreted by women; it is easy for a woman to imagine the worst.


Why women talk:
- To gather information
- To explore and discover what it is she wants to say
- To feel better when she is upset
- To create intimacy


How to a support a man in his cave:
- Don't disapprove of his need for withdrawing
- Don't try to help him solve his problem by offering solutions
- Don't try to nurture him by asking questions about his feelings
- Don't sit next to the door of the cave and wait for him to come out
- Don't worry about him or feel sorry for him
- Do something that makes you happy. Anything that distracts her or helps her to feel good will be helpful to him.


It is very difficult for a man and to differentiate between empathy and sympathy. He hates to be pitted. That's why too much caring for him is smothering.






Part Five: Men are like Rubber Band.

When a man loves a woman periodically, he needs to pull away before he can get closer. A man automatically alternates between needing intimacy and autonomy. 

Chasing behaviors:
- Physical: When he pulls away, she physically follows him.
- Emotional: When he pulls away, she emotionally follows him by worrying about him, feeling sorry for him.
- Mental: She may try to pull him back mentally by asking him guilt-inducing questions or trying to please him becoming overly accommodating.

Punishing behaviors:
- Physical: When he begins to desire her again, she rejects him. She pushes away his physical affection
- Emotional: When he returns, she's unhappy and she blames him
- Mental: When he returns, she refuses to open up and share her feelings







Part Six: Women are like waves.

There are three points each man should realize:
- A man's love and support cannot instantly resolved a woman's issues
- A woman going into her well is not a man's fault or failure
- A woman has within itself. The ability to spontaneously rise up after she has hit the bottom

Avoiding arguments and fights, certainly is healthy but not by 






Part 7: Discovering Different Emotional Needs

We expect the opposite sex to behave just like us.

Women need to receive:
- caring
- understanding
- respect
- devotion
- validation
- reassurance

Men need to receive:
- trust
- acceptance
- appreciation
- admiration
- approval
- encouragement







Part 8: How to avoid arguments

One critical pair of problems from which arguments arise:
- The man feels that women disapproves of his point of view
- The woman disapproves of the way the man is talking to her.


Five major reasons a man stops giving:
- Martians idealize fairness.
- venetians idolize unconditional love.
- Martins give when they are asked.
- Venusians say yes even when the school is uneven.
- Martians give penalty points.
