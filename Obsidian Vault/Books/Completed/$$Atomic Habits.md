Chapter 1:: The surprising power of tiny habits 

Habits compound over time.
 Outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits. Breakthrough transformations are habits compounding over time to unleash major change.

Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results. 
 The purpose of setting goals is to win the game. The purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game.

If you want a better results, then forget about setting goals. Focus on your systems instead. It's not about any single accomplishment; it's about the cycle of endless refinement and continuous improvement.
 



 
Chapter 2:: Your habits shape your identity

The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes part of your identity. It is simple two-step process. Decide to type of person you want to be. Prove it to yourself with small wins.

Every action is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. So vote carefully.





Chapter 3:: How a build better habits in 4 simple steps 

Whenever you want to change your behavior, 

1. make it obvious? 
2. make it attractive
3. make it easy 
4. make it satisfied

A habit is a behavior that has been repeated enough times to become automatic. The ultimate purpose of habits is to solve the problems of life with as little energy and effort as possible.

Any habit can be broken down into the feedback loop that involves four steps: cue, craving, response and reward.

Chapter 6:: Environment.

Motivation is overrated. Environment is invisible hand that shapes human behavior.

Every habit is initiated by cue. We are more likely to notice cues that stand out. Make the cues of good habits obvious in your environment. Reduce exposure to the cue that triggers the bad habit.  Gradually, your habits become associated not with a single trigger, but with the entire environment.


chapter 9:: Environment Again. 

The role of the family and friends in shaping your habits. The culture we live in two influences which behaviors are attractive to us.

We tend to adopt habits that are priced and approved by our culture because we have a strong desire to fit in and belong to the tribe. Most days would rather be wrong with the crowd than be right by ourselves.

One of the most effective things you can do to build better habits is to join a culture where your desire behavior is the norm and you already have something in common with the group.


chapter 12:: Environment Again. Again.

Human behavior follows the wall of least effort.
 Reduce the friction associated with good behaviors. When friction is low, habits are easy. Increase the friction associated with bad habits.


 





Chapter 5:: Rule One: make it obvious.

The first law of behavior change is to make it obvious. Many people think they lack motivation, when what they really like is clarity.

The two most common cues are time and location. Creating an implementation intention is a strategy you can use to pair a new habit with a specific time and location. The implementation intention formula is: I will <Behavior> at <Time> in <Location>.

 


Chapter 7:: Inverse Rule One: Self-control is not sufficient.

The inversion of the first law of behavior change is make it invisible. Reduce exposure to the cues that triggers the bad habit. It's easier to avoid temptation than to resist it.

 



 


Chapter 8:: Rule Two: make it attractive.

The second law of behavior change is make it attractive. The more attractive and opportunity is, the more likely it is to become habit-forming.

Habits are a dopamine-driven feedback loop. It is the anticipation of reward, not the fulfillment of it that gets us to take action. The greater the anticipation, the greater the dopamine spike, the more attractive it becomes.

 
 

chapter 10:: Inverse Rule Two: make it unattractive.

The inversion of the second war of behavior change is to make it unattractive. Habits are attractive when we associate them with positive feelings and unattractive when we associate them with negative feelings.








Chapter 11:: Rule Three: make it easy. 

The third way of behavior change is to make it easy. The most effective form of learning is practice, not planning. Focus on taking action, not been in motion.

chapter 14:: Inverse Rule Three: make it difficult.


Chapter 15:: Rule Four: Make it satisfying.
The cardinal rule of behavior change: what is immediately rewarded is repeated, what is immediately punished is avoided. To get a habit to stick, you need to feel immediately successful, even if in a small way.
