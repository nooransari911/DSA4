The first part: explanation of the most baffling moments in our lives when feeling overwhelms all rationality.

The second part:: on emotional intelligence: the ability to rein in emotional impulse; to read another’s innermost feelings; to handle relationships smoothly.




The tendency to act is implicit in every emotion.

There are two minds: rational and emotional. The more intense the emotion, the more dominant the emotional mind becomes. Our emotional mind is subject to “hijacking” — the limbic brain proclaims an emergency and triggers a reaction before our neocortex can process whether such action is a good idea.









**_Five Main Domains of Emotional Intelligence:_** 

1. Knowing one’s emotions — self awareness
2. Managing emotions
3. Motivating oneself
4. Recognizing emotions in others
5. Handling relationships




**_Pure Types — The Male High IQ vs Male High EI_**

Male IQ – Adept in the realm of mind but inept in the personal world. Typified by a wide range of intellectual interests and abilities. He is ambitious and productive, predictable and dogged, and untroubled by concerns about himself. He also tends to be critical and condescending, fastidious and inhibited, uneasy with sexuality and sensual experience, unexpressive and detached, and emotionally bland and cold.

Male EI – Socially poised, outgoing, and cheerful, not prone to fearfulness or worries rumination. They have a notable capacity for commitment to people or causes, for taking responsibility, and for having an ethical outlook; they are sympathetic and caring in their relationships. Their emotional life is rich, but appropriate; they are comfortable with themselves, others, and the social universe they live in.

Of course, these are extremes. We’re all a hybrid.




**_Showing Emotion_**

Three ways: a) minimize emotion (Japan style), b) exaggeration, and c) substitution (yes instead of no, in Asian culture). How well we display these emotions is a factor in our social competence.

Men vs Women — Women on average feel the fuller range of emotions and express them with greater intensity, hence they’re “more emotional” than men.




**_Marital Relations_**

In one study of marriages men had a rosier view than the wives of just about everything in their relationship — lovemaking, finances, ties with in-laws, how well they listened to each other, etc. Wives in general are more vocal about their complaints than are their husbands. In bad relationships, when one partner screws up, the other blames it on the character of the person, not as a misdeed.

– be specific
