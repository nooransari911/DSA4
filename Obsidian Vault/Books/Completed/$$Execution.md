Discipline One:: Focus on the wildly important. 

The first discipline:
 1. identify goals that will make disproportionately larger impact than others
 2. focus all your energy on them rather than on several other mediocre goals
 3. make this the new normal




One wildly important goal [WIG]:

WIGs are the goals you must achieve must achieve with total excellence **beyond** your day-to-day circling priorities.

Select what is *wildly* important. Say 'no' to other not-so-important goals on your radar. Then you must approach that WIG with utmost focus and diligence until it is delivered as promised with excellence. 

That doesn't mean you abandon other important goals. They're still on your radar, but they don't require focus right now.

WIG can be incremental or disruptive innovation; in product, process, position, or market.

Your real aim is not only to achieve it, but also then to make the new level of performance and natural part of your team's operation.

 

 
Identifying the WIG:

In identifying your WIG, don't ask what's most important. Instead, begin by asking if every other area of your operation remained at its current level of performance, what is that one area where change would have the greatest impact? Look for what makes disproportionately large impact. This question changes the way you think and lets you clearly identify the focus that would make all the difference.




Pitfalls of leaders:

1. ambitious, creative leaders tend to do do more, not less
2. hedging bets, i.e., doing too many things simultaneously
3. tendency to *not* say no to not-so-important goals
 
 
 









Discipline Two:: act on the lead actions. 

The second discipline:
1. apply disproportionately large energy to the activities that drive you to lead actions
 



Lag measure is about action already taken; lead action is action that can be taken.

Lead action is 
1. influential
2. (directly) actionable, i.e., it is an that can be done


 
 
 



Discipline Three:: Drive Engagement; keep a compelling scorecard. 

Characteristics of a compelling player score card:
1. It has to be simple
2. Can I see it easily? It has to be visible to all players. Visibility drives accountability. 
3. Does it show lead measures and the lead actions?
4. Can I tell at a glance the progress? You need to be able to tell with a five second glance the progress. 
 
 
 


 



Discipline Four:: Accountability Drives Execution.

Without accountability, team members go off in all directions with each doing what he or she thinks is the most important under this approach. The Whirlwind soon takes over.




Cadence of accountability:: 
1. frequently recurring cycle of accounting for past performances
2. planning to move the scoreboard




WIG Session 
 
The rules for WIG Session 
1. A WIG session should be held on the same day and at the same time no matter what
2. WIG session is limited exclusively to moving towards achieving WIG. The daily whirlwind is never allowed into a WIG session, no matter WHAT.
3. Aim for 20-30 minutes WIG sessions. Teams/people should learn to conduct fast, efficient sessions.

The agenda 
1. account report on commitments
2. review the scoreboard; identify what worked and what didn't
3. clear the path for new commitments
4. discuss and make new commitments




The black and the gray

When visualizing the day, the gray represents the time dedicated to the whirlwind, the day-to-day. The black represents your weekly commitments to the WIG.

Your week will not be dominated by black, and that's ok.
