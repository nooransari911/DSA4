**_Attached : The New Science of Adult Attachment and How It Can Help You Find – and Keep – Love_** **_by_** **_Amir Levine and Rachel Heller_**




– Anxious people are often preoccupied with their relationships and tend to worry about their partner’s ability to love them back  
– Avoidant people equate intimacy with a loss of independence and constantly try to minimize closeness.  
– Secure people feel comfortable with intimacy and are usually warm and loving.

_Attached_ guides readers in determining what attachment style they and their mate (or potential mate) follow, offering a road map for building stronger, more fulfilling connections with the people they love.




**Where Does Our Need For Relationships Come From?**

Genetically we’re programmed to be in relationships, but how we _relate_ to our romantic partners is where attachment theory comes in.


**We’re Only As Needy As Our Unmet Needs**

Depending on a significant other for emotional nourishment is good for our mental and physical health.

The "dependency paradox" states that our need to depend on others makes us independent. Emotionally fulfilling relationships provide stability and emotional nourishment that help us navigate life with less anxiety and more courage.




**What’s Your Type?**

**What’s Your Partner’s Type?**

Secure types are individuals who strike a balance in relationships: providing space, intimacy and support when needed, communicating desires and needs with each other. In disagreements, they strive for fairness and compromise.

Anxious types want intimacy. They are sensitive to their partner’s moods or behavior. They need someone to provide them with emotional security, reliability, and availability. If you  can provide these, then they will be loving and devoted partners.

Avoidant types alternate between needing intimacy and needing space. Avoidants value independence and may withdraw or end the relationship if they don't have enough space. Moving in together or getting married are not things they take lightly.




**Effective Communication Is How We Find and Keep Love

Effective communication is essential in a relationship, but it can be difficult to talk about touchy subjects, especially in the early stages.  
  

- We tend to sweep worries and touchy topics under the rug, but this doesn't work.
- We learn to spell out our needs and concerns early on. We need to learn to be brave and assertive.
- We should use specific examples to illustrate our concerns to avoid misunderstandings. We should stick to concrete language and avoid the blame game.




**Learn To Fight Right**

The Hollywood notion of conflict-free romantic relationships is a myth. Fighting can bring us closer and make us happier, but we need to learn to fight right.  
  
- Communicate your needs and feelings explicitly.  
- Pay attention to your partner's well-being and validate their needs and feelings.  
- Argue carefully. Use concrete language and concrete examples. Stick to the issue at hand. Don't let the conflict escalate into something completely different. 
- Don't withdraw or play the "silent treatment" card.
- If conflicts can't be resolved or compromises can't be made, it may be time to walk away from the relationship.

If we can learn to stay present, engaged, stick to the issue at hand, and remain sensitive to our partner’s happiness, not only can we resolve conflict, but respect it as a way to build intimacy.




**In Conclusion**

What our authors make clear is this: ‘The ultimate secret to a happy relationship lies in finding a partner who is able to meet your needs.’

At some point, we might have to accept that our partner’s wants and needs are incompatible with our own. Rather than judge ourselves or our partner, we can acknowledge and appreciate our deep relational needs, and align ourselves with someone whose needs and expectations are more in line with our own.
