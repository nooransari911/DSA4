- Focus only on the net immediate action.
- Build Momentum.
- If it takes less than 2 minutes, then do it right now.
- Set smaller goals.
- Commit for: "I will do X at location Y at time Z". That time should be reserved exclusively for X and block out all distractions.
- Block out time for distractions as well.
- Try: 10 min work -- 2 min rest.
- Set (artificial) deadlines.
- Analysis-paralysis: Seeking to do things with 100% perfection. Focus on doing things rather than doing things perfectly.
- Visualize the process, not the outcome.
