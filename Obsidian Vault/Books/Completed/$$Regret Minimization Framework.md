Sometimes you have to make tough decisions in life. Maybe you have to decide whether or not:
- you should quit your existing job
- start a new relationship
- end a relationship
- move another city/country


Decision to start Amazon was one such tough decision for Jeff Bezos. He had a well-paid Wall Street job with a stable career, good boss and a balanced life. But he had his crazy idea of selling books online and starting his own company. He had full support from his wife and the people around him thought he had a good idea. He had to make a decision. It was a tough decision.

So he looked around for advice. Because he didn't find good advice on the topic, he created a new framework: the regret minimization framework.


The idea behind the regret minimization framework is pretty simple: project yourself forward to the age of 80. Looking back on your life, you want to minimize the number of regrets. Looking in hindsight reduces confusion caused by various possible paths in the present moment.

For Jeff decision became simple. He knew he would regret it for the rest of his life if he didn't participate in one of the biggest revolutions the world has ever seen: the information revolution. He knew he wouldn't regret trying and failing, but he knew he would definitely regret not trying to realize his idea.

Your priority list should be built by what you would regret not trying to achieve.

However, Regret Minimization Framework is not an excuse to do something stupid.




So have a list of your potential regrets, but always take your current level of competencies, the right timing, environmental factors and other forces in consideration. Don't look for perfect conditions.


>We are stubborn on Vision, we are flexible on details.
-- Jeff Bezos.





No matter what you decide, make sure you have a strategy, you know your risks, you want to have a low risk with a massive potential reward. Ideally, you have support from the environment: market trends, closest friends.
