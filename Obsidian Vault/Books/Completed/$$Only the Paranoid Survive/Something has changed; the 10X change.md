*New rules prevail now, but nobody told us what those rules were and when they rendered previous rules obsolete.*

		The forces
	</h2>
</html>

There are six fundamental forces affecting any business:
1. Power, vigor and competence of:
	1. Your Current Suppliers
	2. Your Current Competitors
	3. Your Current Complementors
	4. Your Current Customers
	5. Your *Potential* Competitors
2. A *Potential* Direct Replacement for your products, your technologies

Relevant "is/are", "what", "why", etc. make the effect and scope of these forces more precise.

When one or more of these forces become 10X larger than they currently are, it becomes a 10X force. The transition period between your current state and the 10X force state is *Valley of Death* `VoD`. Actions and strategies do not work as they used to. You lose control of your business.


The transition is gradual and its beginning is never obvious, possibly even in retrospect.

		Strategic Inflection "Point" [SIP]
	</h2>

`SIP` is transition "point", when the balance of forces shifts from the old structure to the new structure. SIP is gradual and is not technically a point. It can be called SIP State. Its beginning is never obvious, possibly even in retrospect.

Everyone is perennially perplexed in `SIP State`. Arguments can be ferocious and selecting the most appropriate/relevant/best argument can look impossible.

1. 
While beginning of `SIP State` is never obvious, its *possible* existence can be sensed. There is a sense that *something* has changed: the attitudes of customers are now different, competitors that previously barely existed are now stealing business from you, the teams that have a history of success are no longer have success the way they used to.

2. 
Then there is a growing disconnect between the plans and reality, between the upper and lower levels in management hierarchy.


3. 
Everyone realizes that the stakes are enormously high and there is no margin for any error. Arguments about the right direction become more serious, more ferocious. Previously cohesive teams become divided.

4. 
Eventually, a new framework, a new understanding emerges. *Hopefully*.

		The When of Appropriate Action
	</h2>
</html>

Given the unclear nature of `SIP State`, how do you know *precisely* when is the right time to take the appropriate action? Unfortunately, you can't.

Timing is everything. Taking appropriate actions strain the company's resources. Shifting balance of forces puts strain on company's resources. By taking these actions while the company is still very healthy, you minimize the total strain on company's resources. You can save more of company's existing strength and resources.

But this means acting even when a lot is unknown and you would have to rely on instinct and personal judgement. Unfortunately, that is the *only* [1] thing you can rely on.

//*comment:*//
[1] Technically, may be not. Absence of *any* relevant data to guide decisions is not necessary. More accurate point would be involvement of *some* instinct and judgement *cannot* be avoided.
