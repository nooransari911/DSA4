Regularly evaluate potential 10X Changes from economical, technological, practical perspectives. Address them more if those changes gain strength.[1]

X-Ray lithography: intel continued to observe it while IBM attempted to realize it as a 10X Change. Intel never deemed it worth-it to switch to X-Ray lithography.

RISC-vs-CISC: intel deemed compatibility with existing software more valuable and powerful than 10X Change from RISC.[2]

People dubbed `Cassandra` can be consistently helpful in recognizing existence of `SIP State`.

`Cassandras` are usually in the middle management, often in the sales department. They spend their time "outdoors" where they can directly experience "the winds". They the first ones to notice changes.

`Cassandras` are much more vulnerable to changes and loses than senior management (like lost sales affects commissions for sales people, technology that does not make it to the marketplace affects technical people). They are more on alert for detecting changes. Consequently, regularly pay attention to changes as reported by them.

		The Trap of First Version

Observe developments of a potential 10X Change. Bad first version is not sufficient to completely write-off the 10X Change.

		Fear and <i>Enabling</i> Cassandras

</html>

Create an environment where `Cassandras` can speak without any fear of repercussions. This is critical to allow existence of `Cassandras`.

[1] This is a passive way. Addressing the 10X Change is very likely to be too-little-too-late.
[2] Argument for compatibility with existing software is much smaller today than it was in the past. This argument assumes non-existence of current or potential strong RISC alternatives. Software compatibility would be irrelevant with a sufficiently strong (strong in price, performance, power, etc.) RISC alternatives.
