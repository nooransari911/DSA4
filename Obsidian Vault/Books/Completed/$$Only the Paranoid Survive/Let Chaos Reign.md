[[Why not do it ourselves#^d77070]]

Managers are not just managers; they are humans as well. They have emotions, and a lot of those are tied up in identity and well-being of the business.

In many instances, personal identity is inseparable from corporate/professional identity. Maintaining objectivity and rational thinking becomes impossible.

Denial ("if only we made XYZ", "if only XYZ were more ABC") is followed escapes (being involved with random actions to avoid directly facing reality and making potentially tough decisions).

		Inertia of Success

When environment changes, we instinctively use what worked previously. This is `Inertia of Success`. `Inertia of Success` is extremely dangerous and can reinforce denial. We refuse to acknowledge uncomfortable changes. We close our eyes, use what worked previously, and hope for the best.

		Early Experimentation

Experimentation serves a guide in `SIP State`.

`SIP State` is too late to be experimenting. Experimentation should begin *before*  `SIP State` when revenue and profits are still strong. These experiments form a strong foundation that company and managers can rely on in the face of *any* crisis, not just `SIP State`.

A Classic. Successfully executing a transformation is a lot easier when 10X Change is not already straining resources of the company.
