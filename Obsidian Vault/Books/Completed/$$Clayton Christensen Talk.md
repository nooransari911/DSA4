2780 --> 344 words






Three types of innovations. The reason why understanding innovation is so critical is that innovation is the target of investment and investment is what creates growth. , and net jobs and net growth

Type 1 :: Disruption

Disruptive innovations. Disruptive innovations create net growth and jobs. Almost all of the growth and jobs comes from this type of innovation.

As computers, automobiles, air travel, internet become more affordable and accessible, more and more jobs were created to create, distribute, sell, service, etc.




Type 2 :: Sustaining

Sustaining innovations. Their role is they make good products better.

They are very important in society because if you don't keep making good products better, margins will fall and the company will dissolve. It is needed for the company to survive. When you go out into the world, most of the innovations that you see are sustaining innovations.

But sustaining innovations actually don't create net growth or jobs.




Type 3 :: Efficiency

Efficiency innovations. Their role is to help you make more with less. Increasing efficiency is important for the company to survive. But by their very nature, efficiency innovations eliminate jobs.

But they create free cash flow and it's kind of neat.

As long as these guys are creating more jobs than those guys eliminate and enough increased cash flow to fund the next generation of disruptive innovations, the economy and company works.

But what's happened in the last 30 years little by little is that this connection [increased cash flow from efficiency innovation --> disruptive innovation] has been cut by unfortunately professors at business schools like me.



Efficiency innovations has better ROI than sustaining innovations. Sustaining innovations has better ROI than disruptive innovations. Consequently, disruptive innovations always struggle to attract capital and managerial attention.

Ultimately, chasing maximum ROI as quickly as possible funnels all the resources available to the company [capital, humans] into efficiency innovations. And that's the problem.
