The innovator's dilemma by Harvard Business School Professor Clayton Christensen. Animated video explained




The book explains how successful companies that dominate their industries fail in the face of disruptive innovation; it is message of caution for leadership companies and a message of encouragement for competitors venturing against these goliaths. 




Type 1 :: Sustaining Innovation

A company follows a path of sustaining innovation when it improves a product's performance based on feedback from its best and largest customers. It's usually about reducing defects and making something faster or more powerful.




Type 2 :: Disruptive Innovation

A disruptive innovation often involves lower performance in many of the key features valued by the market. A disruptive product appears as if it's doing everything wrong. A large company with sophisticated and demanding clients can't adopt such a technology. Why would anyone want to focus on a disruptive innovation?

The subtle but key difference is that sustaining innovation satisfies customers' **current** needs whereas disruptive technologies in business models evolve to meet customers' **future** needs. These two types of innovation are at the core of the innovator's dilemma.




Even though disruptive innovations may not make sense in the short term, they simply can't be ignored. Companies need to listen to their customers in order to continue successfully with their sustaining innovations, but they need to look at niche markets and how they use their products in order to identify potentially disruptive innovations and embrace them.



  
For startups, indifference of incumbents to disruptive innovation is good news.
