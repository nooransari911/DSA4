lesson 1. 
The number one way to be seductive is to be unpredictable. Humans are pattern-seeking machines. Analyzing everything is one of our biggest strengths.

There's an aura of mystery, paradox and intrigue around someone who's hard to understand. That doesn't mean you should create artificial complexity, but break patterns.

Above all, don't be an easy target. Play hard to get, not because it works, but because you should be. You're worth it.




lesson two
there are nine types of seducers and they all have different dominant strategies. While always being good for a surprise is a necessary condition for all successful seductions, people tend to choose certain strategies over others. We don't like finding patterns. We embody them.

- The charmer. We all feel comfortable in a charmer's presence. They lift us up by highlighting our best traits rather than focusing on presenting themselves.
- The charismatic. Some traits radiates From the inside out. Confidence, purpose, contentment, sexuality. When someone has an intense aura on the outside, but stays rather detached, we can't help but be smitten.
