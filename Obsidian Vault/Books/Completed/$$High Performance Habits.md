Effectiveness in life does not come from focusing on what is automatic, easy or natural for us. Rather, it is the result of how we consciously strive to meet life's progressively harder challenges to grow beyond our comforts and deliberately work to overcome our biases and preferences. It's about rising to serve a mission, not the mission bowing down to match.

If you have great ambitions to contribute extraordinary things, then you have to grow and stretch far beyond what's natural to you to rise to high performance. You'll have to work on the weaknesses, the uncomfortable, develop entirely new skill sets beyond what you find easy or what you like to do.

		 Section seven: Sustaining Success.
	</h2>
 </html>
 

 Negative patterns of thinking, feeling that slowly but surely kill humanity, zest, well-being. The traps that kill high performance are superiority, satisfaction and neglect. 


 Trap one: superiority.

  People with a sense of superiority have feel that they are better, more capable, more deserving. The more you absolutely believe something, the more likely you are to be oblivious to new developments, situations, perspectives and opportunities.
  
  First step is awareness and staying humble. Humility is a foundational virtue that enables others virtues.

 
 
 
 Trap 2: Dissatisfaction
  Sense of satisfaction is critical for optimal performance and inner peace.
 
 


 Trap 3: Neglect
 
  Obsession in one area of life leads to a cascade of negative events elsewhere.

  First cause of neglect is oblivious. Obsession in one area of life makes you oblivious elsewhere.

  Second cause of neglect is overreaching. Overreaching is when targets far outstrip your abilities. Relax, slowdown, be more strategic.







The #1 thing:

Confidence. Confidence makes you rise to challenge. It enables a lot. HP have more confidence than others: I am confident in my ability to achieve my goals in spite of resistance and challenges.

When someone is more confident, they have better clarity, energy, productivity, influence, courage.

1. Competence

 Better skill increases competence and confidence. Competence and confidence form a positive feedback loop.

 HP are learners. Their belief that they can learn whatever they need to win in the future increases their confidence in their current skills.


2. Be honest


3. Enjoy connecting with others

 You can connect with more people by being interested in them than by trying to get others interested in you.
