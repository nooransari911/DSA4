Characteristics of ideal leader:

- Takes complete responsibility for the outcome
- Has humility and courage to take responsibility for mistakes and failures
- Looks objectively without ego or personal agenda

The only meaningful measure for a leader is whether the team succeeds or fails.





Part One: Winning the war within

Taking complete responsibility for failure is difficult and requires extraordinary humility, and courage. And that is critical to learning and growing as a leader

Extreme ownership requires leaders to look at organization's problems *only* through the objective lens of reality, without emotional attachments to agendas or plans.

Check your ego. Be confident, not cocky. Ego disrupts everything: the planning process, the ability to take good advice and the ability to accept constructive criticism.




Part Two: the laws of combat.

Cover and move. Cover and move means all elements within the greater team are critical and must work together to accomplish the mission. 

Simplify as much as possible. When things go wrong--and they inevitably do go wrong--complexity compounds issues that can very quickly spiral out of control into absolute disaster. It is responsibility of the leader to ensure that everyone in the team understands the plans and orders.

On the battlefield, countless problems compound into a snowball. Every challenge complex in its own right, each demanding attention. The leader must determine the highest priority task and execute.

Build smaller teams.




Part 3, sustaining Victory.

Intelligence gathering and research are important, but they must not impede swift decision making. Waiting for the 100% right and certain solution leads to delay in decision and inability to execute swiftly. That is often the difference between victory and defeat.

Leader must be prepared to make an educated guess based on previous experience, knowledge of how the enemy operates, likely outcomes, and whatever intelligence is available in the immediate moment.
