>Life is never fair and never will be.
>Success is not rewarded to the hardest. It is rewarded only to those who develop and use their unfair advantages.
>Life isn't fair. But if you use the unfairness of life as an excuse to have a victim mindset, to stop yourself from striving to achieve your goals, to make your dreams a reality, then you are only shooting yourself in your foot.

- Lack of courage. Ignore baseless criticism.
- Have fun.

- Manage Anxiety.

![[Pasted image 20231014134952.png]]

- Greet your anxiety. "Oh hi, this is my anxiety". Acknowledge that anxiety is normal and natural. Acknowledging anxiety prevents anxiety from spiraling out of control.



![[Pasted image 20231014135045.png]]


- Reframe public speaking as a conversation, not conversation.
	- Start with questions. It gets the audience involved. It gets both the presenter and audience comfortable.
	- Use conversational language.



![[Pasted image 20231014135313.png]]

- Bring yourself in the present moment.
	- Exercise
	- Speak aloud tongue twisters
	- Count from 1 to 100




![[Pasted image 20231014135757.png]]



![[Pasted image 20231014135911.png]]


- Perfectionism gets in our way.
- Game:: Point to object. Shout anything but the object's name. Ignore patterns or stockpiles of names.

Brain that acts very fast to solve problems correctly sabotages spontaneous speaking. It trains our brain to be reactive.



Look at spontaneous speaking as an opportunity.

- Game:: Give imaginary gift to a partner. The partner opens the gift and says the first thing that comes to their mind. Then you have to justify your gift: "I knew you would like <what your partner said> because ...."



Slow down and listen to the other person. We jump ahead.



![[Pasted image 20231014143913.png]]
Respond in a way that has a structure.

Structure increases the effectiveness through which we process information. We process structured information 40% more effectively and efficiently than unstructured information. Structure keeps audience engaged.

Structure increases focus. Structure enables you to focus on the what rather than the how. Now you won't have to think about what and how simultaneously.

Structures:
![[Pasted image 20231014144702.png]]

-  Problem - solution - benefit structure.

![[Pasted image 20231014144711.png]]

- What? - so what? - now what?


In spontaneous speaking, you have to figure out what to say, how to say. Structures help with how to say.

- Game: Sell a slinky [child's toy] to your partner.


TLDR:
1. Manage your anxiety: acknowledging anxiety, reframing as a conversation, being in the present moment.
2. Get out of your own way.
3. See interactions as opportunity, not challenge.
4. Listen to the other one.
5. Use Structures.
