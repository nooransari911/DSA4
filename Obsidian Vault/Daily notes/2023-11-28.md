Cinema and social media is a very profitable industry and very harmful for us.

Motivation is a very profitable business for creators.

1. The challenges we face are not barriers to our growth, but rather the path to growth itself.
2. Ensure success against all odds.
3. Regret Minimization Framework.

2. Small progress is fine
3. Don't compare yourself with others

3. Consumption scam
Belief :: that you can consume indefinitely whatever you want
Reality :: You need to be a creator to achieve anything. You need to invest your time and energy to learn/create whatever.

4. Money scam

The challenges we face are not barriers to our growth, but rather the path to growth itself. Overcoming challenges develops mental strength and masculine charisma.

When life is comfortable without challenges, moderately hot girls looks dangerously hot. When you are not doing things that you fear, you fear girls.

Masculine charisma is like muscle. It is developed by dealing with challenging, uncomfortable situations over time.

Your true identity is that you don't have a certain rigid fixed identity. You can have/develop any identity you want. 


Red pill :: this is just focusing on sales and does not work over long time.


Self-development is more important than social skills, but social skills is also important. Self-improvement is a way to feel more confident. It is not an alternative to developing social skills.

Your value matters more than anything else, especially beyond just relationships. Your sales pitch becomes somewhat irrelevant with a sufficiently high value.


Rise above standard expectations. Standard expectations will not make you extraordinary. RUTHLESS FOCUS ON GROWTH. You will automatically feel masculine and dominant.

Do it.



### [# Stop Chasing Girls, Attract Them Like A Masculine Bad Boy üóøüíØ (High Value Man)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr1G3zujBfo)

When you look for love, intimacy, emotional support, you become feminine. This is not attractive to girls.

Validation is the *only* thing that matters for girls. If they receive it form you, you have some value for her. If they receive if from somewhere else, you have no value for her.

Use your validation as reward when she does something you want. Make her work for your validation.

Showing your inner emotions is validation for girls. SO hide them.

When you don't show your inner emotions to girls, only then do they desire to get closer to you.

The more important she is for you and the more you work to please her, less important you are for her and the less attracted she will be towards you. For girls, nice = weak.

See yourself as a badass masculine man, a man who gets/does whatever he wants.

Be rational and logical.

Nothing attracts girls like arrogance, discipline and focus.

Arrogance is productive. Arrogance makes you work harder than anything.

When you want her more than she wants you, when you want love and affection from her, it is weakness. Girls can immediately see and it makes you unattractive.

The less control she has over you, the more attracted she will be towards you.

Your absence matters more than your presence.

Girls don't want men who have already fallen in love with them. They want men who can love them.

Maintain strong eye contact. Strong eye contact demonstrates that you are not overwhelmed by her.

Fear is indistinguishable from love. Pain is indistinguishable from pleasure.
